To become an instructor you need to pass several exams and prove your skills. Instructors have access to secret repository to maintain private pages and documents that are not visible to random visitors.

# Know-How

Our website is distribute in many repositories. The main repository is the /root repository. When you start your contribution you must fork or clone: /immages and /root repositories into a working folder: ~/sagecode. You must copy all files from /root into the working folder. We do not work with a repo in a repo, so we don not maintain the copy. This is just for testing. Instead we maintain the /root repository and copy again to working folder for further testing.
