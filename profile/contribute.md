# Contribution

You can contribute to our content if you are part of our team or not, but is more easy to work with us if you are part of our team. Anybody can fork our repository. Instructors, developers and students have direct access to several repositories. Direct commit in repository is enabled depending on your role.

## Guests

As a guest you can visit our homepage and start learning for free. You do not have to register or login to our website to do it. Any visitor who enjoy Sage-Code content can join our Discord server for suport and mentoring. After you join you become one of us. We give you a role and you can have access to contribute to our projects.

## Forking

You can fork any of our repositories. We do not accept PR requests from random visitors that we don't know. You must connect with an Instructor or Developer who can merge PR requests. We advice you to avoid extra work. As a guest you can clone our repositories instead of forking. Later if you get a role you will be able to work in branches and commit. We will merge the branches into main or you can do it yourself.

## Teams

On Discord you can claim a particular role to become member of Sage-Code team. We do not have any registry database and we do not collect e-mail addresses nor phone numbers. You can ask for a role on chat room. If you are approved you will receive an invitation for GitHub and you can accept this invitation to work with us. You will next be assigned to work items.

## Students

As a student, you can have access to extra resources, not available for random guests. This include secret links and voice rooms where we share presentations and schedule work sessions. Students can make PR requests for any of our projects. We grant direct access to specific training projects so you don't need to fork some of the projects.

## Developers

To become a developer on Sage-Code you must be active on Discord. Post some info about your goals and skills on our #team channel and read the rules. An instructor will send you DM for an interview and will assign you the role. Developers have direct access to all our projects and can work in developer branches.

## Instructors

Sage-Code instructors are professional developers with experience that we can trust. Instructors are moderators and code maintainers. As an instructor you can accept PR from students and you can merge code into main branch. To become an instructor you need to pass several exams and prove your skills. Instructors are our partners and have access to private Sage-Code projects.

# Work environment

Our website is distributed in many repositories. The main repository is the /root repository. When you start your contribution you must fork or clone: /root and /immages repositories into the working folder: ~/sagecode. You must copy all files from /root into the working folder. This is just for testing. We maintain the /root repository and copy again to working folder for further testing. 

## Project clone

Usually a developer work on a single tutorial. Therefore you can clone the specific tutorial in the working folder, for example ~/sagecode/java. If you have installed immages properly, you can open index.html in local browser without installing any special software. We use relative links to find the immages and the style files that should be located in ~/sagecode/images (work folder).

## Publshing 

After you make any modification in ~/sagecode/root folder, you need to run publish.sh to copy over the new files in the work folder ~/sagecode so you can see locally the new version. After you verify to look good in the browser you can commit the root repository. In the future we will have automation scripts that will publush your modification to our website. At this time we do manual work to publish all modifications to the website.

## Get started

You can ask questions on Sage-Code general [discutions](https://github.com/orgs/sage-code/discussions) board. Every repository has also a discution board and a read.me file that contains info about that particular project. Follow this info and update new info when you have it.

**Follow up:**

1. Visit: [Sage-Code Laboratory](https://sagecode.net)
2. Join us: [Sage-Code Discord](https://discord.gg/fAEHfw8T)
3. Clone: [Images repo]
4. Clone: [Root repo]

After these steps you are ready to contribute. Publish ~/sagecode/root using ./publish.sh command. Then you can open the website locally onf-line. This is great to learn without internet connection. Also you can navigate and check your favorite programming language or project. Start contributing and commit often.

Learn and prosper üññüèº
